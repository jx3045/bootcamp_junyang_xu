# Stakeholder Summary

## Project Overview
This project develops a complete data pipeline, from raw data ingestion to final reporting. It provides predictive modeling, reusable code, and structured documentation to ensure long-term maintainability.

## Key Outcomes
- Cleaned and processed raw data into reliable datasets.
- Built predictive models and saved the best model for deployment.
- Generated clear reports for stakeholders.
- Created modular functions to ensure reusability.

## Business Value
The pipeline enables **faster decision-making** by automating repetitive data preparation and modeling tasks. It ensures results are **consistent, transparent, and reproducible**.

## Next Steps
- Deploy the trained model via API for real-time predictions.
- Add automated monitoring of model performance.
- Expand to more datasets and integrate into production environments.

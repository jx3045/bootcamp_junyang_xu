    "- **Reproducibility and documentation**:  \n",
    "  Writing clear instructions so that others can launch the app and query it without confusion. \n",

    "### Which part of your repo is most reusable in a future project?\n",
    "The **model training script (`src/train_model.py`)** is the most reusable component.  \n",
    "It is structured, handles missing values robustly (with median imputation), logs key steps, and produces a saved model artifact.  \n",
    "With small modifications to paths and input schema, it can be reused for many regression projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### If a teammate had to pick up your repo tomorrow, what would help them most?\n",
    "The **README file and the reports folder** would be the most helpful.  \n",
    "The README provides a clear overview of the repo structure and workflow, while `/reports/` contains detailed documents (EDA report, orchestration plan, framework guide).  \n",
    "These make the project easy to navigate and ensure that a new teammate can understand the lifecycle without digging deep into code immediately.\n"
